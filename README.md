# My-Travel-Blogg-2021
A travel blog built using React 
A personal travel blog built with React.js This is my first React Project. Using React I built a travel blog detailing 3 places I visisted in 2021 in South Africa Within my components I have a Card.js file and Navbar.js where I separated each component that feeds into the App.js file that holds all the information for the travel blog. I stored all my raw data in the data.js file and pulled this information through into each pf the respective components within the App.js file.
